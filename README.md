# This repository will return at a later date.
Apologies for the inconviencence to anyone who has used the BallisticNG repository up until now. Because of BallisticNG being near to release on Steam with online features, I thought it would be best to keep the repo private for now to reduce the chance of easy cheating. BallisticNG **WILL** be back on github in the future with online features stripped.

The BallisticNG wikia wiki will be updated soon with all of the modding documentation.
